# Mini-Project-Gussing-the-numeber
Number guessing game project
The steps of the game are as follows:

First, the user specifies a number in his mind and does not tell the computer this number (does not give the number as input to the computer) (a number between 1 and 99)

We run the program

The program guesses and prints a number

The printed number creates three modes

1- Or it is bigger than the number you have in mind that you type the letter k to tell the program that the number in your mind is smaller than the number printed by the program and the program must guess and display another number and .. (It should be noted that in this case, by typing k, the program must guess a smaller number than its previous guess to end the game sooner)

2- Or the printed number is smaller than the number you have in mind, you tell the program with the letter b that the number in your mind is bigger than the number printed by the program and the program must guess another number and Show and ... (It should be noted that in this case, by typing b, the program must guess a larger number than its previous guess to end the game sooner)

3- Or the printed number is the same number that was in your mind and by typing the letter d you tell the program that it guessed correctly and the program ends
